# Introduction

Managing large application state easily and with high performance is one of the hardest problems
in the cloud today. We present FASTER, a new concurrent key-value store designed for point lookups 
and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external storage. 
What differentiates FASTER are its cache-optimized index that achieves very high performance — up
to 160 million operations per second when data fits in memory; its unique “hybrid record log” design
that combines a traditional persistent log with in-place updates, to shape the memory working set 
and retain performance; and its architecture as a component that can be embedded in cloud apps. FASTER
achieves higher throughput than current systems, by more than two orders of magnitude, and scales better 
than current pure in-memory data structures, for in-memory working sets. FASTER also offers a new consistent
recovery scheme that achieves better performance at the expense of slightly higher commit latency.
